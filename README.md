# Connect N - My first dev project

Connect N is my first C development project carried out during as freshman student.

This is the same principle as the game of connect 4, but with N points to align to win. However, one more specificity, we can choose if we want to remove or add a token. We can play alone against an "AI" (very simple) or with two players. All the game takes place on the terminal and is coded in C.

## Get started

To start the game, you just have to execute the main.c file in your IDE or in the terminal.
You can also compile the project.

NB: The game is in French and the code too... (I was a freshman student at the time). 

NB2 : The game is tested only on windows.
