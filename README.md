# Connect N - My first dev project

Connect N is my first C development project carried out as freshman student.

This is the same principle as the game of connect 4, but with N points to align to win. However, one more specificity, we can choose if we want to remove or add a token. We can play alone against an "AI" (very simple) or with two players. All the game takes place on the terminal and is coded in C.
You can also save your game and load it later ;)

## Get started

To start the game, just compile the project 

NB: The game is in French and the code too... (I was a freshman student at the time). 

NB_2 : The game is tested only on windows.

Enjoy the game !
